# Learn OpenGL

This project is a keeper of **LearnOpenGL** course.

You can see here: https://learnopengl.com

I already have a repository where the course was started at once.

This repository is a new begin, it's a second repository where I will remake the chapters.

---

## Structure

Every **Chapter** is a *branch*, example:

- chapter/hello-window
- chapter/hello-triangle
- chapter/shaders

And so on!

To see a specific **Chapter**, just *checkout* there.

---

## Exercises

Some **chapters** have **exercises**.

Each **exercise** will be a *branch* as well as **chapters**.

Example:

- exercise/two-triangles

The exercises have no defined title, so I'll name it based on the exercise objective.

## Building

You'll build it using CMake.
